# Which-Fruit-is-this-
Imagine that you went out to buy some apples in the market. You find that there a variety of apples some priced high and others lower. Their size is also different. Won't it be helpful if you can get some info about which variety of apple this is and what is its speciality (flavor, sweetness, etc.)? This is called the classification problem. 

In this project, I have trained a NEURAL NETWORK MODEL on the training dataset having 131 classes of fruits, having more than 100 images of each type.

AIM OF THE PROJECT: This model will take a fruit image as input and predict "Which fruit is this!".

--> The python code is in the file named "code.py".
-->The results of the model (accuracy, loss,F1-SCORE etc.) are in the file named "output.txt".
--> The training and testing datasets(attached) were taken from the KAGGLE website.
